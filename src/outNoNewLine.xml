(discussed in #4)#60 based on #59 - Bar 100% fullLet's re-cap the goals: To encourage the user to create a strong password.First, look at existing conventions in use in the industry. Over time, more people will become familiar with this functionality as thoughtful developers include password checking. It's good to work within the existing UI conventions and establish a common language for users.See someone who attempted as many experiments (full bar, temperature bar, filling bar. but always with colour changes):http://subeesh.wordpress.com/2008/02/19/flex-password-strength-meter/ - you can resize the bar and compare as many.Some photos of patterns here: http://ui-patterns.com/userset/39/image/553#focusAlso check a video I made of Google's password checker:http://www.flickr.com/photos/feather/3921759419/You can see those shown are "long"; the text is above the bar, not written on it; the colour bar is a thin strip.Let's reconfirm our spec:1) We need a progress bar2) Green from start is confusing.3) The colour changes should not be so jarring.4) Text should be legible and transmit same information as colour/visual changes.5) It needs to work in translation so that words can fit into the space in other languagesThis indicates text above the bar, not on it, and a thin strip of colour so as not to be over powering.In fact we were closer in the beginning of this patch to existing conventionshttp://drupal.org/files/issues/password-strength-meter.pngSomehow we tried to make the progress bar "small", and fit the text together. This appears to have introduced some problems. We may also run into trouble if translations are not as short and don't fit into the bar.I recommend we take a step back from making and applying patches, try out this experimentation page:http://subeesh.wordpress.com/2008/02/19/flex-password-strength-meter/And come to a consensus to save valuable developer's time.Login or register to post comments</plainContent><date>Tue Sep 15 14:28:00 CDT 2009</date></comment><comment><title>http://drupal.org/node/331893#comment-2043438</title><commentNumber>62</commentNumber><author>mcrittenden</author><authorLink>http://drupal.org/user/420631</authorLink><content><p>@heather great post. :)</p><p>What do you all think about going the route of the first example at <a>http://subeesh.wordpress.com/2008/02/19/flex-password-strength-meter/</a> ...you get all the colors but it's not as jarring since it's a gradual fade.</p><ul><li><span><a>Login</a> or <a>register</a> to post comments</span></li></ul></content><plainContent>@heather great post. :)What do you all think about going the route of the first example at http://subeesh.wordpress.com/2008/02/19/flex-password-strength-meter/ ...you get all the colors but it's not as jarring since it's a gradual fade.Login or register to post comments</plainContent><date>Tue Sep 15 12:35:00 CDT 2009</date></comment><comment><title>http://drupal.org/node/331893#comment-2043470</title><commentNumber>63</commentNumber><author>alexanderpas</author><authorLink>http://drupal.org/user/41017</authorLink><content><p><a>http://drupal.org/files/issues/password-strength-meter.png</a> - first response: YUK! ugly! too wide!</p><p>I'd say, use <a>http://drupal.org/files/issues/Picture%209_12.png</a> style, but from grey to green!</p><ul><li><span><a>Login</a> or <a>register</a> to post comments</span></li></ul></content><plainContent>http://drupal.org/files/issues/password-strength-meter.png - first response: YUK! ugly! too wide!I'd say, use http://drupal.org/files/issues/Picture%209_12.png style, but from grey to green!Login or register to post comments</plainContent><date>Tue Sep 15 12:48:00 CDT 2009</date></comment><comment><title>http://drupal.org/node/331893#comment-2044250</title><commentNumber>64</commentNumber><author>mgifford</author><authorLink>http://drupal.org/user/27930</authorLink><content><p>@heather - love the history you laid out for this bike shed.</p><p>Think the most critical part is that we're adding the password strength label as per #40.</p><p>Also, thanks for pointing out that the password changer suddenly went from a Google style password checker to something more unique to Drupal.</p><p>I'd like to take it back to the Google style so I started with #17.</p><p>I added a reference for Good so that there are now four categories.
