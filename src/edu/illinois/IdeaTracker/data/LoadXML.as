This has been a highly requested feature in the previous ticket around this. We initially said no to this request for the following reasons :The visual emphasis would be put too strongly on the password, that it would again scream at you - scaring people off.The way we structure the password validator now, should make it clear that as you're filling in the password checker the green bar will full up, assuming people don't use \"a\" as a password some of the suggestions would disappear and you would be left with a couple - which should trigger the behaviour of filling it up (as filling it in removed some recommendations).We wanted to lay the strong visual emphasis on password matching, which is for the user the more important information (as otherwise he cant complete the form)The scenario you purposed could very well be true, that people go like \"its green\" so its good - while you want to trigger \"I can make it greener\". But so could the scenario \"it's not really green at all, lemme fill it up\" its kind of something we should test rather then just assume one scenario.About adding description, it could definitely help for accessibility and maybe also people who don't really take the time to associate colour and just read and click submit. But I am not sure how we could place that in the interface and whether or not it really triggers those folks - to avoid adding even more clutter we should really think about this one)To many people it sounded as an obvious solution, so it might be weird that we initially decided against it. But you have to consider that sometimes what big other sites do, might not work for people using Drupal.Login or register to post comments</content><date>11/08/2008</date></comment><comment><title>http://drupal.org/node/331893#comment-1098971</title><commentNumber>3</commentNumber><author>webchick</author><authorLink>http://drupal.org/user/24967</authorLink><content>So I want to clarify something as someone who was there witnessing poor users struggle with the password checker at U of M.The problem wasn't the colour taking focus away from the fact that passwords didn't match. The problem was the *proportion* of the coloured big ugly box related to other things in the form, and how it magically popped out of nowhere:If you really want to make the password match status more visible, stick a little checkmark/stop sign logo next to it like we have in admin/reports/status. But I think that might clutter the form unnecessarily. The colour is diminished here already because the area the colour takes up is MUCH smaller than it was before.Here's why I filed this issue, and a summary of my arguments \"pro\" this:* I got hung up here for a good 30 seconds or so thinking there was a bug. Since this was confusing for me -- I'm a user of Drupal too :P -- it's likely going to be confusing for others as well. alpritt pointed out though that I'm not exactly a \"typical\" user of Drupal, which might be true, but people who use Drupal every day are *also* our target market, remember. ;)* yoroy pointed out that red is wrong because red means \"stop\" \"error condition\" etc. However, green is normally a colour that means \"Yay! everything is great!\" and in NO way is \"a\" a great password. :P* Furthermore, this green bar is not a check for \"did someone fill in the form\" (otherwise we'd have green bars next to ALL of our required fields), it is an indicator for the strength of the password. And in terms of password strength, \"a\" *is* an error condition: it's horribly insecure.* Every dynamic password checker I can remember using on any site does it the way Google does it. Jakob Nielsen points out that other people use other sites more than yours, so I'm not sure why we're not conforming to user expectations here.* Bojhan pointed out that the above wan't true; Yahoo! does not use colour this way. However, it uses four separate rectangles to indicate the \"how far along are you\" which tells me there are 4 steps to secure passwords. Ours is just a bar along a single continuum so the correlation is not a direct match.I think those were all the major points from our discussion.Login or register to post comments</content><date>11/08/2008</date><images><image>http://img.skitch.com/20081108-g3qhmc2jtccfxj2itkk3rw3349.png</image></images></comment><comment><title>http://drupal.org/node/331893#comment-1099053</title><commentNumber>4</commentNumber><author>alpritt</author><authorLink>http://drupal.org/user/91319</authorLink><content>@webchick:My point was not that you are a highly experienced user of Drupal, but more that you have been involved in this specific issue. So you fall on the developer rather than user side, and so are more likely to be looking for problems. So, yes, there may be an issue here; but there is not necessarily one. We need to test against naive users to get a proper understanding.I took a look at a couple of dozen password checkers before designing the current implementation. The current design is a lot closer to the norm, than what we had before. But as for getting closer to it, I'm not sure we can because there is really not a consistent design between them. So, at this more subtle stage, I again think we really need to test. I could argue the merits for the change either way.Another option may be to go from grey to green.Login or register to post comments</content><date>11/08/2008</date></comment><comment><title>http://drupal.org/node/331893#comment-1099081</title><commentNumber>5</commentNumber><author>webchick</author><authorLink>http://drupal.org/user/24967</authorLink><content>Another option may be to go from grey to green.I think you meant green to grey. :) If so, I think that would definitely help. If the bar had been purple or grey or polkadots I don't think my brain would've triggered the \"wtf?\" It was the fact that green == OK that messed me up.Could we talk about that in a separate issue though, since this one is about colourizing them?I agree that I'm too close to the issue, and that the way to figure out the way forward is with actual user testing. So if someone rolls a patch for this and we get it committed, we can get two groups of users: one testing UNSTABLE-X (2 or 3 or whatever has the old behaviour) and one testing HEAD with the new way, and take notes on who was least confused. :DLogin or register to post comments</content><date>11/08/2008</date></comment><comment><title>http://drupal.org/node/331893#comment-1099207</title><commentNumber>6</commentNumber><author>alpritt</author><authorLink>http://drupal.org/user/91319</authorLink><content>Rather than red to green, I mean.

I think we need to emphasize that a weak password is Danger-Will-Robinson bad. Neither green nor gray convey that meaning. Even outside of European and American cultures, gray carries a neutral or indefinite connotation.I'm attaching the strength meter Microsoft uses on their online sign-up form. It has only four states. The gray state is used before the user has entered anything into the password field.There are three visual indicators here: the color, the length of the bar, and the black text inside the bar (compared to the dimmed text).ms-passport.png7.77 KBIgnoredNoneNone</content><date>12/21/2008</date><images><image>http://drupal.org/files/issues/ms-passport.png</image></images></comment><comment><title>http://drupal.org/node/331893#comment-1173297</title><commentNumber>12</commentNumber><author>Dries</author><authorLink>http://drupal.org/user/1</authorLink><content>I think this is a good patch, but it seems like we're not 100% done discussing the colors yet.

The latest patch gives colours (at least 6 of them), bar size, and a word. Remember that we're trying to NOT scream at people on this form, lest we go back to the problems with the old password checker. The current one actually tested pretty well so I'm not sure this is as much a priority as we previously thought it was, but I defer to the UX team about that.Also, I noticed that if I type in a strong password and then delete the password contents and then type 'a', it gives me a short green bar rather than a short red bar.Login or register to post comments</content><date>03/16/2009</date></comment><comment><title>http://drupal.org/node/331893#comment-1465546</title><commentNumber>26</commentNumber><author>Josh Waihi</author><authorLink>http://drupal.org/user/188162</authorLink><content>I find a current problem with the current password checker is that I don't use the mouse to scroll down the install page but just tab my way through it, which means when I get to the password fields, I don't see the meter below, I have no idea how strong or weak my password is.

Gotta stop doing that.I'm glad that you went back to the color scheme in #11. The \"red-yellow-green\" metaphor to traffic signals is clean and works well for everyone who can distinguish those colors, regardless of whether they can see the true hues. The text is essential, so it's fantastic that it's there.Here's my original post, which I won't edit because it makes other strong and valid points:Reading through this thread, I see that the verdict on color has gone back and forth. I have a lot more confidence in sites that use color and text to encourage me to develop a strong password. I'll bet most other Web users do, too.The text is essential. The color is an enhancement. One caveat: If color is used, check it with one of the many free color contrast analysis tools available online. If used as a background, make sure it is light enough that it doesn't reduce the contrast ratio with the text below 4.5:1 â€” preferably closer to 7:1. (In these patches, the text seems to be running small.) And if the color is used for text, be sure that it is dark enough that its contrast ratio to the background is in that same range.Otherwise, a lot of us will be relying on screen readers to operate this interface.

It started right below the password strength checker and went down the rest of the page. I also think the position of the text was wrong, but that might have been a result of the big green background colour.Who were the people who didn't like the colour? I am not sure which concerns we're addressing by not having more than one colour. Could all be grey I suppose, but right now it's solid green. Think for sighted people Red/Yellow/Green is good.

The metaphor is to traffic lights. Traffic lights typically change color, not size, so the changing size of the bar muddles the metaphor. and weakens the message.On top of that, what does the changing size mean? Here are a couple of plausible misinterpretations:Because a two-character password produces patch of red twice as big as the patch produced by a one-character password, a two-character password is twice as bad as a one-character password.At about five characters, the color is yellow. Is a 5-em \"caution\" more emphatic than a 1-em \"stop\"?So the implication of the change in size is the opposite of the implication of the change in color â€” at least it is until we get to green.Here's another way of thinking about it:Red means \"Don't proceed.\"When only one character has been entered, we especially don't want the person to proceed.Currently, the signal that person gets is the smallest in our series, so it's possible that they'll miss it.If we keep the signal the same size and change only its color, we don't have to worry about whether they will miss it when its message is most urgent.I see only one drawback to making all signals the same size: The user would not get the idea that a password with a strength factor of 85 is not quite as good as a password with a strength factor of 100. If that troubles you, I suggest we just keep the bar yellow at 85. For it to turn green, the strength factor would have to reach 100 (or whatever other value you consider prudent).Login or register to post comments</content><date>09/15/2009</date></comment><comment><title>http://drupal.org/node/331893#comment-2042300</title><commentNumber>60</commentNumber><author>mgifford</author><authorLink>http://drupal.org/user/27930</authorLink><content>Ok, here's another one for review. Based on @Cliff's suggestion of the bar being 100% full. I still like #43.Slight changes include actually including 4 states.

Not actually sure how to do it.

(discussed in #4)#60 based on #59 - Bar 100% fullLet's re-cap the goals: To encourage the user to create a strong password.First, look at existing conventions in use in the industry. Over time, more people will become familiar with this functionality as thoughtful developers include password checking. It's good to work within the existing UI conventions and establish a common language for users.See someone who attempted as many experiments (full bar, temperature bar, filling bar. but always with colour changes):http://subeesh.wordpress.com/2008/02/19/flex-password-strength-meter/ - you can resize the bar and compare as many.Some photos of patterns here: http://ui-patterns.com/userset/39/image/553#focusAlso check a video I made of Google's password checker:http://www.flickr.com/photos/feather/3921759419/You can see those shown are \"long\"; the text is above the bar, not written on it; the colour bar is a thin strip.Let's reconfirm our spec:1) We need a progress bar2) Green from start is confusing.3) The colour changes should not be so jarring.4) Text should be legible and transmit same information as colour/visual changes.5) It needs to work in translation so that words can fit into the space in other languagesThis indicates text above the bar, not on it, and a thin strip of colour so as not to be over powering.In fact we were closer in the beginning of this patch to existing conventionshttp://drupal.org/files/issues/password-strength-meter.pngSomehow we tried to make the progress bar \"small\", and fit the text together. This appears to have introduced some problems. We may also run into trouble if translations are not as short and don't fit into the bar.I recommend we take a step back from making and applying patches, try out this experimentation page:http://subeesh.wordpress.com/2008/02/19/flex-password-strength-meter/And come to a consensus to save valuable developer's time.Login or register to post comments</content><date>09/15/2009</date></comment><comment><title>http://drupal.org/node/331893#comment-2043438</title><commentNumber>62</commentNumber><author>mcrittenden</author><authorLink>http://drupal.org/user/420631</authorLink><content>@heather great post. :)What do you all think about going the route of the first example at http://subeesh.wordpress.com/2008/02/19/flex-password-strength-meter/ ...you get all the colors but it's not as jarring since it's a gradual fade.Login or register to post comments</content><date>09/15/2009</date></comment><comment><title>http://drupal.org/node/331893#comment-2043470</title><commentNumber>63</commentNumber><author>alexanderpas</author><authorLink>http://drupal.org/user/41017</authorLink><content>http://drupal.org/files/issues/password-strength-meter.png - first response: YUK! ugly! too wide!I'd say, use http://drupal.org/files/issues/Picture%209_12.png style, but from grey to green!Login or register to post comments</content><date>09/15/2009</date></comment><comment><title>http://drupal.org/node/331893#comment-2044250</title><commentNumber>64</commentNumber><author>mgifford</author><authorLink>http://drupal.org/user/27930</authorLink><content>@heather - love the history you laid out for this bike shed.Think the most critical part is that we're adding the password strength label as per #40.Also, thanks for pointing out that the password changer suddenly went from a Google style password checker to something more unique to Drupal.I'd like to take it back to the Google style so I started with #17.I added a reference for Good so that there are now four categories.

It's something I was struggling with in putting the dark warning behind the text.

Even though the checker in the video based on #60 was what I asked for, I see the merits of and actually prefer the checker in the video based on #64. I don't think we need a \"Too Short\" state. (In fact, I'm not sure \"Good\" is necessary, but I wouldn't call for a recode to get rid of it. People will understand.)@Everett, both versions have text labels that correspond to specific colors, so I think we are OK there.@Heather, thanks for the summation. In the frenzy of fixing things, it can be hard to stay focused on the goal. And moving the color bar from behind the text and to the side actually does make it look like a progress meter, not a traffic signal. I can't explain why, but it does. In that light, allowing it to grow is just fine.I think that anything further is gilding (or perhaps bronzing) the lily. Let's call it done.

It won't be addressed by an image or a sketch, its a conceptual direction we either agree on or just ignore.But if you need a accessibility/usability point, if we do a copy-c, copy-v at least do it correct and implement the four colors.Login or register to post comments</content><date>09/18/2009</date></comment><comment><title>http://drupal.org/node/331893#comment-2065466</title><commentNumber>80</commentNumber><author>Dries</author><authorLink>http://drupal.org/user/1</authorLink><content>I think this is a step forward.

Just because Google does it doesn't mean it makes sense. As I said before, the analogy to traffic signals is understood everywhere there is enough traffic to have signals â€” and many places where there isn't, because railroads use the same convention.If having four colors will get this done, then, fine, let's have four colors. But I don't understand why you've decided that I and others involved in this discussion have no concern for \"the Drupal brand.\"If the Drupal brand was so important to you, why did you wait until just four days ago to bring it up â€” comment #76 â€” when this issue has been around for over 10 months? I really would have been happy to consider that point, and I'm sure others would have been, too.It's not that we don't care. It's just that we hadn't thought about it from that perspective. Had the suggestion come up earlier, perhaps one of us would have thought of a way to make the Druplicon look weak, fair, pretty good, and then as strong as Superman, and Mike could have written code to support that model. And maybe the result would have worked for all of us â€” and maybe not, but at least we could have had the discussion (and Mike would have had more of an opportunity to respond to your request).Please, in the future, if something really does matter to you, get it out into the discussion early. Don't ambush the rest of us with a new thought at the end.Login or register to post comments</content><date>09/22/2009</date></comment><comment><title>http://drupal.org/node/331893#comment-2069406</title><commentNumber>85</commentNumber><author>yoroy</author><authorLink>http://drupal.org/user/41502</authorLink><content>Cliff: comment #2 by bojhan makes similar points. It's not an ambush. Bojhan speaks from experience in seeing people *stumble only a little bit* over the password checker during usability tests. Most of this was fixed in another issue, explicitly leaving the colors out of the discussion because they don't really matter that much in the total of this specific interaction. Then this issue got created and look here, we're almost 100 comments in, talking about which color to paint the bikeshed. Sure, with accessability improvements committed along the way, but still going on about picking colors.What we're trying to argue here is that we should try and make our own choices, *not* copy google or others because the context in which this interaction happens is so different. Here it's part of a much longer installation process, most other examples given here are part of a much shorter and simpler signup. I guess Bojhan's last comment was cynical in the sense of \"if we don't dare to make our own informed choices, then be sure to go all the way in copying\".It's fixing things that are not broken. See #83, which is feedback from actual usage for example. It's just frustrating to see so much energy being put into what's mostly a non-isssue based on assumptions rather then actual usability testing.And I guess it's equally hard to tell who's who and who knows what they are talking about from just reading comments, but yeah, that's the issue queue for ya.Login or register to post comments</content><date>09/22/2009</date></comment><comment><title>http://drupal.org/node/331893#comment-2069424</title><commentNumber>86</commentNumber><author>Bojhan</author><authorLink>http://drupal.org/user/87969</authorLink><content>[Edit : yoroy said it all]@Cliff Sorry I just didn't have the strength anymore, to get in earlier - I missed that we reached consensus so I didn't put in my voice earlier.Login or register to post comments</content><date>09/22/2009</date></comment><comment><title>http://drupal.org/node/331893#comment-2069452</title><commentNumber>87</commentNumber><author>Bojhan</author><authorLink>http://drupal.org/user/87969</authorLink><content>oopsLogin or register to post comments</content><date>09/22/2009</date></comment><comment><title>http://drupal.org/node/331893#comment-2072898</title><commentNumber>88</commentNumber><author>Cliff</author><authorLink>http://drupal.org/user/295067</authorLink><content>@yoroy and @Bojhan: Perhaps one day we can swap stories and share a few laughs over an appropriate beverage. I hope so. Still, I stand by my earlier comments. In #2, Bojhan does not mention anything about Drupal branding. Not even a hint. And to the extent that he's expressing concern about the usability test results, I think webchick in #3 quite clearly refuted his notion that the use of color was the actual source of the problem.I, for one, have never seen Google's password checker. Everything I contributed came from the experience and professional judgment I've developed in years of Web design, Web redesign (!), and usability testing. So, although the \"red-yellow-green\" color scheme might not have been creative or even original, it would have been effective, and the suggestion that those who participated in this issue simply aped Google was completely out of line.The well-designed small patch of red in the recent patches is a far cry from the big, ugly, obtrusive, and, coincidentally, red error message that triggered the problems in the usability test. I agree wholeheartedly with the point I hear from webchick in #3: It's important to incorporate testing by potential users into the design process, but it's even more important to be sure we identify and fix the actual source of each significant problem that process identifies.In this case, the right answer was to replace something that was big, ugly, and obtrusive with something elegant â€” not to get rid of the color.Login or register to post comments</content><date>09/23/2009</date></comment><comment><title>http://drupal.org/node/331893#comment-2073776</title><commentNumber>89</commentNumber><author>mgifford</author><authorLink>http://drupal.org/user/27930</authorLink><content>@Heather suggested a palette in #53. Might be others to explore too. There are four places to add color if we want it to. lighter to darker green is one option.

No two adjacent pairs have sufficient contrast to pass at level AAA; only one of the pairs passed at level AA for large text (which I assume would be similar to any bar used).Keeping in mind that people who use the Web spend far more time on other sites than they do on yours, let's go with Google's palette. That will keep things simple and familiar.Unless someone wants to come up with five different versions of the Druplicon, ranging from anemic to robustly healthy, to use in place of a progress bar, and can do so in less than three weeks, I don't see a way of making everyone happy.Login or register to post comments</content><date>11/12/2009</date></comment><comment><title>http://drupal.org/node/331893#comment-2257492</title><commentNumber>93</commentNumber><author>mgifford</author><authorLink>http://drupal.org/user/27930</authorLink><content>I don't know of a way to pass variables from a theme's .info file into jQuery.
